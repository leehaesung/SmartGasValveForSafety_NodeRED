# Smart Gas Valve For Security By NodeRED, MQTT v3.1

***

## Introduction
This instructables will cover the basic steps that you need to follow to get started with open sources such as Node-RED, MQTT v3.1. MQTT(Message Queueing Telemetry Transport) is a Machine-To-Machine(M2M) or Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity protocol that was designed to be extremely lightweight and useful when low battery power consumption and low network bandwidth is at a premium and connection quality could be unreliable. It was invented in 1999 by Dr Andy Stanford-Clark and Arlen Nipper and is now an Oasis Standard.

The different tutorials can cause a great deal of confusion, which is why I have tried to make the easiest setup possible. Specifically, this instructables will cover how to code the Node-RED on Raspberry Pi2 as a MQTT client by connecting to your home wireless network and how to send sensor data ( we are going to send sensor data to test, and the installation guides of Raspberry Pi2, Node-RED will not really be covered in this instructables).

The following are the materials we will be using :

* Raspberry pi2 (Pi-1,2,3 are Possible.): Installation guide || Download here
* Wifi dongle (If you have Pi-3, it's unnecessary.)
* Magnetic switch sensor
* Smartphone's portable battery
* Nod-RED: Use the version pre-installed in Raspbian Jessie image since November 2015. Installation guide
* MQTT v3.1
